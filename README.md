# Project 5: Comparison of Learning Rate Schedulers

This project presents a comparison of three different learning rate schedulers used in training deep neural networks: CosineAnnealingLR, MultiStepLR, and StepLR.

## Overview

In this analysis, we explore the effects of different learning rate schedulers on the training process and model convergence. We consider the following observations for each scheduler:

- **CosineAnnealingLR**: The training loss decreases gradually with each epoch, indicating that the learning rate is being reduced gradually. This suggests that the model is able to find better minima over time by reducing the learning rate.

- **MultiStepLR**: The training loss decreases more abruptly at the beginning and then gradually with each epoch. This suggests that reducing the learning rate at specific milestones (as set by the user) has helped the model converge faster and find better minima.

- **StepLR**: The training loss remains constant throughout all epochs. This suggests that reducing the learning rate after a fixed number of epochs is not enough to help the model converge.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, the comparison of learning rate schedulers reveals the following insights:

- All three learning rate schedulers were able to reduce the training loss, but CosineAnnealingLR and MultiStepLR appear to be more effective than StepLR in this particular case.

- CosineAnnealingLR demonstrated a gradual decrease in loss over time, indicating that it allowed the model to find better minima.

- MultiStepLR helped the model converge faster and find better minima by reducing the learning rate at specific milestones.

- StepLR did not seem to have any significant effect on the model's performance in this case, as the training loss remained constant throughout all epochs.

It's important to note that the effectiveness of a learning rate scheduler can vary depending on the dataset and model architecture. Experimentation with different schedulers is recommended to determine the most suitable one for a specific task.
